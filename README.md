# PhotoViewer

A photo viewer app which fetches photos from Flickr.

## Features

### 1. Research
You can search anything from Flickr
The first 25 photos are displayed, and when you scroll to the bottom of the collection, 25 more photos are loaded.

### 2. Show detail
When you click on a photo, an uncropped version of the photo and its title appear with a zoom in effect. This view offers multiple features:
#### * Zoom
You can zoom to see more details in your photo 
#### * Swipe left or right
You can see the previous or next photo by swiping
#### * Swipe down
To close the detail and go back to the photo collection and research
#### * Long Touch
You can share the photo by long touching it

## With more time
#### Better loading of the photos
I would have used the SDWebImage library to handle the photo displaying 

#### Better animation
I would have worked on a smoother and better designed animation

#### Performance optimization
